## About this project

This project is designed for my practicum course where users can order foods through online in easy way.
In this Online Restaurants Food Ordering System Project in PHP focuses mainly on ordering food and managing food items.
Also, the system displays all the lists of available dish categories.
In addition, the system allows managing food items too.

This project is divided into two categories: Admin and User-Side. 

Here the users can register freely, order the foods they wish from the wide varieties of restaurants, 
view their order status and get delivered.

In this system, the Admin has the most privileges. 
The Admin can able to add/edit/view/delete users, add/edit/view/delete restaurants, add/edit/view/delete categories, 
add/edit/view/delete menus and edit/view all users orders through Admin Panel.
